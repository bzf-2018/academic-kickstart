<center> <h1>Research - Civil Computing</h1> </center>

Dr Baoâ€™s research interest is mainly on database management with a recent focus on big geo-spatial data. I propose the topic of **Civil Computing** and has made significant contributions in developing interactive visualized data exploration frameworks to bring big data back to a human scale, to **make big data empower everyone for optimal decision making**. These civil computing problems include:

- The budget-constrained facility deployment that benefits the optimal deployment of gas stations, electric charging stations and advertisement.

- The trajectory data exploration that benefits public transportation network optimization and traffic flow prediction.

- The one-size-fits-all point of interest (poi) and trajectory search engine that benefits personalized trip planning.

- The location-centred interactive visualized analytics that benefits real estate house seeking.

To solve the above civil problems, Dr Bao is the first of few developing **end-to-end** solutions that cross three disciplinaries: Data Management, Information Retrieval and Data Visualization. His inter-disciplinary methodology involves:

- design effective data usability modules in the front end.

- propose efficient evaluation algorithm in the mid end.

- provide efficient storage and indexing schemes in the back end.

Each end has mutual impact to the others in solution design, while it is usually assumed to be orthogonal to each other in single-discipline research. His proposed cross-disciplinary methodology is creative and highly endorsed by international peers, as evidenced by his publication in top venues of Information Retrieval such as WSDM, SIGIR, top venues of data management such as SIGMOD, ICDE, KDD, TKDE, VLDB Journal, and top venues of Data Visualization such as EUROVIS, JVLC.

<center><h3>Research Project 1: Influential Facility Site Selection</h3> <center>
**Research Problem 1.1 - Trajectory-driven Influential Billboard Placement**: Given a set of billboards U (each with a location and a cost), a database of trajectories T and a budget L, find a set of billboards within the budget to influence the largest number of trajectories. One core challenge is to identify and reduce the overlap of the influence from different billboards to the same trajectories, while keeping the budget constraint into consideration.
