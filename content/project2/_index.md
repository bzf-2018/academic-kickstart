<center> <h1>Research - Civil Computing</h1> </center>

Dr Baoâ€™s research interest is mainly on database management with a recent focus on big geo-spatial data. I propose the topic of **Civil Computing** and has made significant contributions in developing interactive visualized data exploration frameworks to bring big data back to a human scale, to **make big data empower everyone for optimal decision making**. These civil computing problems include:

- The budget-constrained facility deployment that benefits the optimal deployment of gas stations, electric charging stations and advertisement.

- The trajectory data exploration that benefits public transportation network optimization and traffic flow prediction.

- The one-size-fits-all point of interest (poi) and trajectory search engine that benefits personalized trip planning.

- The location-centred interactive visualized analytics that benefits real estate house seeking.
