I am an Associate Professor at RMIT (School of Computing Technologies) and an Honorary Senior Fellow at The University of Melbourne. I obtained my PhD in computer science from National University of Singapore and was the winner of [the Best PhD Thesis Award](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/awards/). I am the Head of the Big Data and Database Group at [the RMIT Center of Information Discovery and Data Analytics](https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/research-institutes-centres-and-groups/research-centres/centre-for-information-discovery). 

I am generally interested in big data management and mining, with a focus on relational data, geo-spatial data and graph data. Currently, my group is working on query optimization in database systems, data quality for ML, data/query pricing, and ML-enhanced algorithms. In the past, I proposed the topic of [Civil Computing](http://civilcomputing.co/) with the mission of using data-driven techniques to **improve every individual citizen's daily life** where three typical beneficial domains are House Seeking, Site Selection and Transportation Planning. 

I am passionate in solving these real-world problems, from which I extract and formalize fundamental research questions, propose theoretically sound and practically feasible-to-deploy solutions. The showcase videos of my group's [projects](https://baozhifeng.net/project2/) are in our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGXKE9sTsI0WFV5ZHbH19QA). On top of that, I have been developing a range of human-in-the-loop data exploration systems to bring big data back to a human scale, to **make big data empower everyone** for optimal decision making. 


I am honored to receive several [research awards](https://baozhifeng.net/awards/), such as the [Chris Wallace Award for Outstanding Research](https://www.core.edu.au/the-chris-wallace-award-for-outstanding-research-contributio) by the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) in [2020](https://mailchi.mp/b3bed90720c3/zz4597ittf-4168873?e=4f86ee5536), Two-time [Google Faculty Research Award](https://research.google/outreach/past-programs/faculty-research-awards/), the [Best Paper Award Runner-up at KDD'19](https://www.kdd.org/awards/view/2019-sigkdd-best-paper-award-winners), and the [Best Paper Award Nomination at KDD'18](https://dl.acm.org/toc/tkdd/2020/14/5#sec1).

I am the Associate Editor of SIGMOD'23 and PVLDB'23. I have been the Associate Editor of PVLDB'21. I regularly serve the Senior TPC of flagship conferences in the broad field of data science such as KDD and WSDM. I do consulting services for industy and government offices, such as [City of Melbourne](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/melbourne-profile/smart-city/citylab/Pages/citylab.aspx) on its Smart City Project and [Victoria Department of Human Health and Services](https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/) on its data quality project. 

In the past, I was the director of [RMIT master of data science program](https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/master-of-data-science-mc267) (2018-2019). Under my leadership, we have created a novel form of data science postgraduate project to support diverse sectors and disciplines within RMIT and put cross-disciplinary collaboration into practice, resulting in a double-win -- students are ready to work through those real-life data science projects; people outside DS but have strong Data Analysis needs get their problem solved. I also co-created the [RMIT-MIT micro-credential program in data science](https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2018/jun/new-pathways-created-between-two-leading-universities), bringing novel pathways for students, where RMIT is the first university in Australia having this connected pathway for data science education. I was the HDR Committee Chair (2020-2021) during which I have fostered an excellence-driven, diversified and inclusive research culture.

**I am looking for students who are of high integrity, highly motivated, self-disciplined and consistent, to work with me**. If you are the one, please contact me. **Four PhD scholarships are available** at the moment.
