We propose a powerful [**platform**](http://115.146.89.158/) to analyze and visualize data, which is applied to many downstream real-worl applications. Specifically, the current platform consists of three systems, HomeSeeker, ConcaveCubes and AOI-shapes, which serve for different applications. 


#### HomeSeeker
HomeSeeker assists users in understanding the local areas and local real estate market, exploring and finding candidate properties based on their individual requirements, and visually comparing properties/suburbs in multiple aspects.

#### ConcaveCubes
ConcaveCubes is a cluster-based data cube to support interactive visualization of large-scale multidimensional urban data.

#### Interactive Trip Planing
We propose AOI-shapes, to support efficient and effective visualization of user-defined urban areas of interest in an interactive manner.
