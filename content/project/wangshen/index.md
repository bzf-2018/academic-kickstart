[**T4 - Trajectories for Traffic, Transport, and Trips**](https://t4research.github.io/) is a powerful platform for analyzing different types of trajectory data, which can be applied to various applications such as Real-time Traffic Monitoring, Intelligent Traffic Signal Control and Interactive Trip Planing.

#### Real-time Traffic Monitoring
T4 enables intelligent analytics over real-time and historical trajectories from vehicles. At the front end, we visualize the current traffic flow and result trajectories of different types of queries. At the back end, T4 is able to support multiple types of common queries over trajectories, with compact storage, efficient index and pruning algorithms.
