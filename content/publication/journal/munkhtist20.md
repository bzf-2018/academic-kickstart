abstract: Moving objects equipped with location-positioning devices continuously generate a large amount of spatio-temporal trajectory data. An interesting finding over a trajectory stream is a group of objects that are travelling together for a certain period of time. We observe that existing studies on mining co-moving objects do not consider an important correlation between co-moving objects, which is the reoccurrence of the co-moving pattern. In this study, we propose the problem of finding recurrent co-moving patterns from streaming trajectories, enabling us to discover recent co-moving patterns that are repeated within a given time period. Experimental results on real-life trajectory data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.
