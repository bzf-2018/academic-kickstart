abstract: Understanding urban areas of interest (AOIs) is essential to decision making in various urban planning and exploration tasks. Such AOIs can be computed based on the geographic points that satisfy the user query. In this demo, we present an interactive visualization system of urban AOIs, supported by a parameter-free and efficient footprint method called AOI-shapes. Compared to state-of-the-art footprint methods, the proposed AOI-shapes (i) is parameter-free, (ii) is able to recognize multiple regions/outliers, (iii) can detect inner holes, and (iv) supports the incremental method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AOI-shapes based on a real-world real estate dataset in Australia.
