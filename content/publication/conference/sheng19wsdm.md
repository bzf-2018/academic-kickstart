abstract: In this paper, we would like to demonstrate an intelligent traffic analytics system called T4, which enables intelligent analytics over real-time and historical trajectories from vehicles. At the front end, we visualize the current traffic flow and result trajectories of different types of queries, as well as the histograms of traffic flow and traffic lights. At the back end, T4 is able to support multiple types of common queries over trajectories, with compact storage, efficient index and fast pruning algorithms. The output of those queries can be used for further monitoring and analytics purposes. Moreover, we train the deep models for traffic flow prediction and traffic light control to reduce traffic congestion
