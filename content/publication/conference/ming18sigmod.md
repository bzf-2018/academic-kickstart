abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a trip planning system called TISP, which enables usersâ€™ interactive exploration of POIs and trajectories in their incremental trip planning. At the back end, TISP is able to support seven types of common queries over spatial-only, spatial-textual and textual-only data, based on our proposed unified indexing and search paradigm. At the front end, we propose novel visualization designs to present the result of different types of queries; our user-friendly interaction designs allow users to construct further queries without inputting any text.
